# Archive - Legacy Development Artifacts

This directory contains legacy development files that were created during the incremental development of the BAC4 Integration Modeller.

## Files

### Phase HTML Files

These files represent incremental development phases and are **no longer actively maintained**:

- **phase1-core-engine.html** - Initial core engine implementation
- **phase2-visual-designer.html** - Early visual designer prototype
- **phase3-extended-patterns.html** - Extended integration patterns implementation

### Current Implementation

The current, fully-featured implementation is in the root directory:
- **visual-designer.html** - Complete, production-ready visual designer with all features

## Why These Files Are Archived

These phase files were part of an iterative development approach but are now superseded by the complete `visual-designer.html` file. They are kept here for historical reference and to understand the evolution of the project.

## Should You Use These Files?

**No.** Always use `visual-designer.html` from the root directory. It includes:
- All features from Phase 1, 2, and 3
- Phase 1: Core UX improvements (multi-select, grid, keyboard shortcuts, mini-map)
- Phase 2: Advanced properties (transformations, schemas, connection testing)
- Latest bug fixes and optimizations
- Complete feature set for enterprise integration modeling

These archived files are provided for reference only.
